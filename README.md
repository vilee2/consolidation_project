# Tuple Out Dice Game

Rules to the Game:
Players score points by rolling dice. 
The goal of the game is to be the first to reach 50 points.
The active player rolls three dice. 
    If all three dice are rolled with same number, player "tupled out" and gets 0 points for that turn. 
    If two dice have same number, they cannot be re-rolled and are considered "fixed".
    Player can re-roll dice that are not "fixed" as much as they'd like or until they "tuple out"
When a player chooses to stop, their points is equal to total of the three dice and their turn ends.
